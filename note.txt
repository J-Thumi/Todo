inline css here is written in 2 brackets outer for js inner for an object
use camel
<h1 style={{color:"blue" , fontSize:"20px"}}>Inline</h1>
you can also def the object separately

css modules are most prefered incase working on a project as a team naming can conflict
here each component has its stylesheet
style.module.css
